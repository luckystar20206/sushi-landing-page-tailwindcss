# `Sushi restaurant landing page with Vite 2.x + Vue 3.x + Tailwind 2.x`

Work in progress 

This is a fork from [https://github.com/web2033/vite-vue3-tailwind-starter](https://github.com/web2033/vite-vue3-tailwind-starter) and customized for a sushi restaurant landing page. Building a mockup with Tailwind CSS is fast, easy to pickup for rapid deployment.


This starter template also includes:

- [Vue Router 4.x](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next)
- [Inter var font](https://github.com/rsms/inter) (self-hosted, woff2, v3.18, with 'preload' attr, check out index.html)
- [Just-in-Time](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) mode by default introduced in Tailwind CSS v2.1 (in preview!)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/vue/menu) - unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS
- [Heroicons](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons#vue) - beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons,
by the makers of Tailwind CSS

First-party plugins needed for Tailwind UI:

- [tailwindcss/forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms)
- [tailwindcss/typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)
- [tailwindcss/line-clamp](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-line-clamp)
- [tailwindcss/aspect-ratio](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-aspect-ratio)
